# UFO Analysis

## Purpose
This project requires us to build a webpage with an interactive table showing UFO data - stored as a JavaScript array. The user can filter UFO sightings data based on date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The page starts with a title, image, and description on "UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy". Below will be a table that lists information on a UFO sighting - date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and any comments. This is what the page looks like at first glance.

The image below shows the table being filtered by date: 1/5/2010 and state: nj.

## Summary

- One drawback of the webpage is that it's hard to know how much information is in the table. For example total sightings, type of shapes, locations. Right now it feels like trial and error to see where the sighting have been without scrolling throught the entire table.

- My first recommendation is to update the filters to accept capitalization. When I filtered by state: nj, it didn't work when I used all caps: NJ, which can be confusing if that mistake isn't caught. Another recommendation is to add a summary table showing calculations such as - common shapes, locations, ect. It would give the user a nice overview and what to expect from filtering the data.
