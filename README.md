# UFO Analysis

## Purpose
This project requires us to build a webpage with an interactive table showing UFO data - stored as a JavaScript array. The user can filter UFO sightings data based on date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The page starts with a title, image, and description on "UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy". Below will be a table that lists information on a UFO sighting - date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and any comments. This is what the page looks like at first glance.


## Summary

- One drawback of the webpage

- Two additional recommendations for further development
